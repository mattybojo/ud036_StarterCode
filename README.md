# A Movie Trailer website in Python

This project builds a website that shows the poster art and trailer for some of my favorite movies.

Project is written and tested for Python 2.7.

## Running the project

1) Download or clone this repository.
2) Open the `entertainment_center.py` file in Python IDLE.
3) Click `Run > Run Module`.
4) If successful, your system's default browser should open and display the webpage.
Click any of the poster images to play the movie's trailer from YouTube.

NOTE: If you close the webpage, you can access it again by following the steps above or by running the
`fresh_tomatoes.html` file that is generated in the project's root directory.
